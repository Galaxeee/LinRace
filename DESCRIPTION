Title: cell division history reconstruction of single cells using paired lineage barcode and gene expression data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xinhai Pan

Description: LinRace (Lineage Reconstruction with asymmetric cell division model), integrates lineage barcode and gene expression data using asymmetric cell division model and infers cell lineages and ancestral cell states using Neighbor-Joining and maximum-likelihood heuristics. On both simulated and real data, LinRace outputs more accurate cell division trees than existing methods. With inferred ancestral states, LinRace can also show how a progenitor cell generates a large population of cells with various functionalities.
