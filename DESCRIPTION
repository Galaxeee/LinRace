Description: Understanding how single cells divide and differentiate into different cell types in devel-7
oped organs is one of the major tasks of developmental and stem cell biology. Recently, lineage tracing8
technology using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has enabled simultaneous readouts of gene expressions9
and lineage barcodes in single cells, which allows for the reconstruction of the cell division tree, and10
even the detection of cell types and differentiation trajectories at the whole organism level. While11
most state-of-the-art methods for lineage reconstruction utilize only the lineage barcode data, methods12
that incorporate gene expression data are emerging, aiming to improve the accuracy of lineage recon-13
struction. However, effectively incorporating the gene expression data requires a reasonable model on14
how gene expression data changes along generations of divisions. Here, we present LinRace (Lineage15
Reconstruction with asymmetric cell division model), a method that integrates the lineage barcode16
and gene expression data using the asymmetric cell division model and infers cell lineage under a17
framework combining Neighbor Joining and maximum-likelihood heuristics. On both simulated and18
real data, LinRace outputs more accurate cell division trees than existing methods. Moreover, Lin-19
Race can output the cell states (cell types) of ancestral cells, which is rarely performed with existing20
lineage reconstruction methods. The information on ancestral cells can be used to analyze how a pro-21
genitor cell generates a large population of cells with various functionalities.
