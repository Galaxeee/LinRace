This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

#library loading
```{r}
.libPaths("/nethome/xpan78/LinRace/Rlib")
library(devtools)
load_all("/project/xpan78/LinRace-temp")
#library(LinRace)

library(TedSim)
library(umap)
library(ggplot2)
library(phangorn)
library(DCLEAR)
library(TedSim)
library(TreeDist)
library(slingshot)
library(readxl)
library(Seurat)
```

#loading 10X objects
```{r}
embryo2a.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "/nethome/xpan78/data_mchan/embryo2/2a/",gene.column = 1)
embryo2b.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "/nethome/xpan78/data_mchan/embryo2/2a/",gene.column = 1)
```

# Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).
```{r}

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
